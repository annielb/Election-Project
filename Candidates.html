<p>Hillary Clinton is the nominee for the Democratic party in the 2016 Election. In fact, she is the first woman
to ever be nominated for a major political party in the United States. She is the wife of former U.S. president Bill Clinton, and
held the position of First Lady of the United States for 8 years during Bill Clinton's two terms as president from 1993 to 2001. After that, she became
the junior United States Senator from New York from 2001-2009. During her time as a senator, she ran for the 2008 Presidential Election, 
but lost the Democratic nomination to candidate Barack Obama, who is currently the president of the United States.
 She served as the 67th United States Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013.</p></div>
